# Brazilian passport dataset
The dataset comprises **5,000** high-resolution synthetic photos of **Brazilian passports**, designed to advance **computer vision** and **identity verification systems**. It provides a secure and ethical resource for training robust models for **OCR** (Optical Character Recognition), **document analysis**, and **spoofing detection**, all without exposing real personal data or sensitive personal information.

By utilizing this dataset, researchers and developers can enhance **security protocols**, improve **detection methods** for fraudulent documents, and build reliable **identity validation systems** without the risks associated with data breaches or handling genuine citizen data. - **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/synthetic-printed-brazilian-passports/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=synthetic-printed-brazilian-passports)**
